          %ul.tos-list
            %li Arbitration. Should a dispute arise between you and QuickBox, we would like to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.

          %ul.tos-list

            %li Severability . If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties' original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of QuickBox to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.
            %li Complete Agreement. These terms of service, together with QuickBox Privacy Policy, QuickBox Storage Service Agreement, and QuickBox's other terms, conditions, and policies, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and QuickBox. This Agreement supersedes any proposal or prior agreement oral or written, and any other communications between you and QuickBox relating to the subject matter of these terms. This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of QuickBox, or by the posting by QuickBox of a revised version.
