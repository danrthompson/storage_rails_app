Arbitration Agreement.

%br/ 

In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and us, you agree to resolve most claims through individual arbitration. The following section explains our arbitration policy. Please read it very carefully, as it affects your rights.
%br/ 
%br/ 

• Arbitration. Should a dispute arise between you and Space You Need, we would like to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Therefore, for any claim (except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights) under this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than $75,000, either party may elect to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement through binding non-appearance-based arbitration.  
• Procedure.   Any disputes arising with respect to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”). The arbitrator shall be selected by joint agreement of the parties. In the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the initiating party providing the other party with written notice that it plans to seek arbitration, the parties shall each select an arbitrator affiliated with JAMS, which arbitrators shall jointly select a third such arbitrator to resolve the dispute. The written decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and enforceable in any court. The arbitration proceeding shall take place in San Francisco, California, using the English language. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and, except as otherwise provided herein, that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties.
• No Right to Jury Trial. You acknowledge that you are waiving your right to a jury trial. Section 12 of this agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
%br/ 
%br/ 


Miscellaneous.  
%br/ 
%br/ 

This agreement is controlled by California law. You, and you alone, are responsible for any obligations you agree to under this contract. If we are involved in a merger or we are bought, we may transfer this agreement, as long as your rights are protected. You may only agree to these terms if you are able to form a binding contract in your state. These terms, including our Privacy Policy, are the complete agreement between us, and no other terms apply.  
%br/ 
%br/ 

• Governing Law. Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and Space You Need and any access to or use of the Website or the Online Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You and Space You Need agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California, except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement.
• Limitation of Term of Action . You agree that any cause of action related to or arising out of your relationship with Space You Need must commence within ONE year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
• Non-Assignability. Space You Need may assign or delegate these Terms of Service, the Storage Service Agreement, and/or QuickBox Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy without Space You Need’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void.
• Section Headings and Summaries Non-Binding. Throughout this Agreement, each section includes titles and brief summaries of the following terms and conditions. These section titles and brief summaries are not legally binding.  
• Severability . If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of Space You Need to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.
• Complete Agreement. These terms of service, together with QuickBox Privacy Policy, QuickBox Storage Service Agreement, and Space You Need’s other terms, conditions, and policies, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and Space You Need. This Agreement supersedes any proposal or prior agreement oral or written, and any other communications between you and Space You Need relating to the subject matter of these terms. This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Space You Need, or by the posting by Space You Need of a revised version.
